，How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
In a Windows system, you can use a tool in the command prompt called FC to find differences between two verisons of a file.

，How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Some text editors would save old versions of a file automatically.

，What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Manual commit means that you can save versions anytime you want,and you can control the size of the changes,but it also has a sort of cons,say that if you forget to commit,it would be too late when you notice that. 

，Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Some version control systems can save mutiple files which are connected,because the version control systems would track the state of these files each time you commit.

A commit is a snapshot of every file in your repository at the time you choose to commit.

，How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Use the command git log to get the commit ID, and use the command git diff to compare two version of a file to know the history of the file.

，How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Use the command git checkout to return a previous version,run the code, and use the command git diff to locate the bugso I donot need to worry about the bugs.


，Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Use git to locate bugs and fix them, and then make kinds of changes and bugs with my code.
